Egyptian Rafter Simulator
-------------------------

Exploring and tearing apart a favourite childhood game of mine.
Aka Egyptian Rat screw

Parts:
* Simulator
* Curses Interface

Current Progress:
* Have built a basic simulator
* Have built a basic curses interface

Todo:
* Need to test the simulator to see if it is working properly
* Need to figure out what is going on with my datastructures
  In trying to be immutable I am using tuples but it is turnign out to be a pain.
  Maybe switch to objects.
* Add history in simulator
* Perform autonomous simulations
* Add in snapping
